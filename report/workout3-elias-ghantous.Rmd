For Paul Romer, 72 of his titles start with a vowel. For William Nordhaus, 242 of his titles start with a vowel, likely because he has many more papers published.

William Nordhaus has more symbols in his titles than Paul Romer but the distribution they both follow is very similar, exponentially decreasing as symbols increase.

William Nordhaus began publishing papers much earlier than Paul Romer. Both authors have steadily increased the numbers of paper published per year until a point where the papers published started decreasing. There are multiple peaks every 10 years or so. Nordhaus published the most papers in 2000 while Romer's highest was 1990. Nordhaus exceeded Romer in papers published almost every year.

Paul Romer's use of three buzzwords "economic", "growth" and "endogenous", spiked repeatedly until 1994 after which the use of these words tailed off. The highest frequency of all words in the graph was "growth" which was used 7 times in 1994.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/word_trends_nordhaus.png')
```
William Nordhaus would use a word around 4 times per year in his titles. The highest frequency of all words in the graph was "change" and "global", both used 6 times at their peak. The word usage for Nordhaus shows more activity 1995 onwards.

```
On average, Paul Romer edges out William Nordhaus when it comes to average number of coauthors which could show that Romer is more willing to work with other researchers than Nordhaus.

The two authors have, in fact, worked together on research in the past.

```
Paul Romer is published in 42 different journals. William Nordhaus is published in 64 different journals. This could show a broader level of expertise for Nordhaus as he is published in many more different journals that could span slightly different topics and fields.

journals_paul_df_citations <- summarise(group_by(journals_paul_df, journal), total_citations = sum(citations, na.rm = FALSE))

journals_paul_df_citations
```
These are Romer's citation counts for each journal. Some are NA as there is no data on the citation number for these journals.

```{r}

journals_william_df_citations <- summarise(group_by(journals_william_df, journal), total_citations = sum(citations, na.rm = FALSE))

journals_william_df_citations
```
These are Nordhaus' citation counts for each journal. Some are NA as there is no data on the citation number for these journals.

```{r}
# most influential journal

arrange(journals_paul_df_citations, desc(total_citations))
arrange(journals_william_df_citations, desc(total_citations))
```
In their academic field, for Romer, the "Journal of Political Economy" is the most influential as it attains the top two spots. For Nordhaus, "The Energy Journal" attains two of the top 5 spots and is repeatedly cited in different volumes later on and so it is the most influential.
